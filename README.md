## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project consists of three main execution options, each offering different levels of sophistication:

1. üíª **main.py** - Basic implementation for local computer interaction
2. üåê **main_playwright.py** - Enhanced implementation using Playwright for browser automation
3. üß© **crew_orchestration.py** - Advanced LangChain-based orchestration with multi-agent capabilities

## üí° Technology Stack Deep Dive

### Playwright Framework

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is a powerful browser automation framework developed by Microsoft that enables reliable end-to-end testing and automation across all modern web browsers. In this project, Playwright is leveraged to:

- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Automate Chrome/Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with the same API
- **Headless and headed mode**: Run browsers visibly or invisibly based on your needs
- **Reliable automation**: Built-in auto-waiting mechanisms ensure actions execute only when elements are ready
- **Network control**: Intercept network requests, modify responses, and simulate various network conditions
- **Mobile emulation**: Simulate mobile devices with precise viewport, user-agent, and touch support
- **Screenshots and video**: Capture high-quality visual evidence of automation sessions

Our implementation in `playwright_computer.py` enhances the standard Playwright features with:

1. **Resilient navigation**: Circuit breaker pattern to prevent repeated failures when navigating to websites
2. **Human-like interactions**: Randomized timing and patterns to mimic human behavior
3. **Screenshot optimization**: Intelligent screenshot capture with quality settings for performance
4. **User-agent rotation**: Configurable user-agent strings to avoid detection
5. **Error recovery**: Sophisticated error handling and retry mechanisms
6. **Session persistence**: Browser state persistence between runs when needed

Example of creating a Playwright instance with our enhanced configuration:

```python
computer = PlaywrightComputer(
    headless=False,
    browser_type="chromium",
    environment="windows",
    start_url="https://www.bing.com/",
    focus_address_bar=True,
    performance_mode=False,
    reduced_waits=False
)
```

### LangChain Multi-Agent Framework

[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) is an open-source framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs). In this project, we leverage LangChain's sophisticated multi-agent architecture to create a robust orchestration layer in `crew_orchestration.py`:

- **Agent-based architecture**: High-level GPT-4.1 agent orchestrates and coordinates with the Computer Use Agent
- **Tool-based framework**: Specialized tools for browser interaction, direct navigation, scrolling, and search
- **ReAct pattern implementation**: Reasoning and acting loop for complex task decomposition
- **System message engineering**: Carefully crafted prompts that optimize agent behavior

Key components of our LangChain implementation:

1. **Agent Executor**: Centralized coordinator that manages the reasoning and action process
   ```python
   self.agent_executor = initialize_agent(
       tools=[browser_tool, navigation_tool, search_tool, scroll_tool],
       llm=llm,
       agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
       verbose=True,
       system_message=system_message
   )
   ```

2. **Custom Tool Implementation**: Domain-specific tools for browser interaction
   ```python
   browser_tool = Tool(
       name="browser_interaction",
       func=self.tools.browser_interaction_tool()._run,
       description="Execute a browser interaction like navigation, clicking, or typing."
   )
   ```

3. **Iterative Feedback Loop**: Browser observations are fed back to the orchestration layer
   ```python
   latest_input = (
       "Here is what the browser currently shows:\n"
       f"{observations}\n\n"
       "Please decide the next concrete browser action. "
       "Remember to use the tool-call format."
   )
   ```

4. **Detailed Report Generation**: AI-generated insights based on execution results
   ```python
   report_content = f"""# Task Execution Report
   ## Task Overview
   **Date and Time:** {time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")}
   **Task Description:** {task_description}
   ...
   """
   ```

This multi-agent approach allows for sophisticated reasoning and action sequences that wouldn't be possible with a single model, enabling complex task completion with better reliability and transparency.

### Computer Use Assistant (CUA) Model

The Computer Use Assistant is a specialized AI model from Azure OpenAI that can interpret screenshots and generate appropriate actions to control a computer interface. This model represents a significant advancement in AI-human interaction capabilities:

- **Visual understanding**: Can interpret complex GUI elements, layouts, and visual cues
- **Context awareness**: Maintains understanding of the current state of the application
- **Multi-modal reasoning**: Combines visual information with natural language instructions
- **Adaptive interaction**: Generates appropriate mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard inputs

Key technical aspects of the CUA model:

1. **Input format**: Accepts base64-encoded screenshots along with textual instructions
2. **Output format**: Generates structured action plans in JSON format specifying:
   - Mouse actions (clicks, movements, drags)
   - Keyboard input (text entry, special keys)
   - Scroll operations (direction, distance)
   - Waiting periods for state changes

3. **Screen resolution handling**: Our `Scaler` class in `cua.py` manages resolution differences
   ```python
   computer = cua.Scaler(self.computer, (1024, 768))
   ```

4. **Integration pattern**: The `Agent` class in `cua.py` handles the communication workflow
   ```python
   self.cua_agent = cua.Agent(client, self.computer_use_config.model, scaled_computer)
   ```

5. **Action processing**: Each action from the model is validated, translated to physical operations, and executed with appropriate timing

6. **Safety measures**: Includes built-in guardrails against harmful or destructive actions

#### Capabilities and Limitations

The Computer Use Assistant excels at:
- **Web navigation**: Browsing websites, filling forms, clicking buttons
- **Search operations**: Finding and extracting information from web pages
- **Simple application control**: Basic interactions with desktop applications
- **Reading on-screen text**: Extracting visible textual information

Current limitations include:
- Cannot see or interact with elements that aren't visually present on screen
- Has limited understanding of highly dynamic or animated interfaces
- May struggle with very complex multi-step operations without guidance
- Works best with modern, accessible interface designs

### Playwright Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Playwright Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a structured protocol for AI models to interact with browser environments through Playwright. While conceptually similar to CUA, the MCP takes a fundamentally different approach to browser automation:

- **DOM-aware interaction**: Operates on structured DOM representation rather than purely visual information
- **Page context understanding**: Has access to the complete document object model and page state
- **Protocol-based communication**: Uses a standardized protocol for browser control and observation
- **Semantic navigation**: Can locate and interact with elements based on their semantic properties

Key technical aspects of the Playwright MCP:

1. **Input format**: Accepts structured context about web pages including DOM trees, accessibility tree, and metadata
2. **Output format**: Generates API-compatible actions for Playwright:
   - Element selectors (CSS, XPath, role-based)
   - Precise interaction commands (click, fill, select)
   - Navigation instructions (goto, back, forward)
   - Evaluation scripts for custom logic

3. **Context generation**: MCP client extracts rich contextual information about the page
   ```python
   context = {
       "url": page.url,
       "title": await page.title(),
       "content": await page.content(),
       "accessibility_tree": await page.accessibility.snapshot(),
       "dom_snapshot": await page.evaluate("() => { /* DOM snapshot code */ }")
   }
   ```

4. **Selective context**: Can request specific parts of the page structure to reduce payload size
   ```python
   element_context = await page.evaluate("""(selector) => {
       const el = document.querySelector(selector);
       return { 
           innerText: el.innerText,
           attributes: Object.fromEntries([...el.attributes].map(a => [a.name, a.value])),
           boundingBox: el.getBoundingClientRect().toJSON()
       };
   }""", "main")
   ```

5. **Execution efficiency**: Direct API calls rather than simulated human interactions
6. **Rich feedback**: Provides detailed success/failure information for each action

## Comparing CUA and Playwright MCP

| Aspect | Computer Use Assistant (CUA) | Playwright Model Context Protocol (MCP) |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Primary Input** | Screenshots (visual) | DOM structure and metadata (semantic) |
| **Interaction Model** | Simulates human actions (mouse, keyboard) | API-level browser automation |
| **Scope** | Any visual interface (desktop/browser) | Browser-only |
| **Visual Understanding** | Complete (can see entire screen) | Limited (requires DOM mapping) |
| **Element Recognition** | Vision-based inference | DOM structure and properties |
| **Failure Recovery** | Requires visual confirmation | Can use DOM assertions and queries |
| **Payload Size** | Large (screenshots) | Variable (can be optimized to specific elements) |
| **Speed** | Moderate (limited by visual processing) | Fast (direct API calls) |
| **Out-of-view Interaction** | Cannot interact with off-screen elements | Can interact with any element in DOM |
| **Dynamic Content** | May struggle with rapid changes | Can attach event listeners for changes |
| **Learning Curve** | Low (natural language instructions) | Moderate (protocol understanding required) |
| **Integration Complexity** | Moderate (screenshot + action pipeline) | Low (Playwright API integration) |

### When to Choose Each Approach

**Choose Computer Use Assistant when:**
- You need to automate both desktop and browser applications
- The interface is highly visual or lacks structured DOM (e.g., canvas-based apps)
- You want to simulate precise human-like interactions
- Your automation needs to adapt to visual changes without code modifications
- Natural language instructions are preferred over programmatic definitions

**Choose Playwright MCP when:**
- You're working exclusively with standard web applications
- Performance and efficiency are critical considerations
- You need to interact with elements that may not be visible on screen
- Your automation needs to handle dynamic content with precise timing
- Deep integration with browser debugging capabilities is required
- You need detailed telemetry about element states and page performance

### Hybrid Approach

This repository demonstrates a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both methods:
- Uses CUA for visual understanding and complex decision-making
- Incorporates Playwright for reliable browser control and standardized navigation
- Adds LangChain orchestration for sophisticated multi-step reasoning

By combining these technologies, we achieve a robust automation system that can handle a wide range of tasks with greater reliability than either approach alone.

### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Configuration-Advanced-purple?style=flat-square&logo=settings" alt="Configuration: Advanced">
</p>

#### üìê Resolution Scaling

The framework automatically scales screenshots for optimal processing by the AI model. You can adjust this behavior:

```python
# Default scaling for different performance modes
scaled_resolution = (640, 480) if args.optimize_screenshots else (800, 600) if args.performance_mode else (1024, 768)
scaled_computer = cua.Scaler(computer, scaled_resolution)
```

#### üåê Browser Configuration

Playwright offers extensive browser configuration options:

```python
# Customize browser launch options
browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(
    headless=headless,
    args=[
        "--disable-dev-shm-usage",
        "--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled"
    ]
)

# Configure browser context
context = await browser.new_context(
    user_agent=random.choice(user_agents),
    viewport={"width": 1280, "height": 720},
    locale="en-US",
    timezone_id="America/Los_Angeles",
    permissions=["clipboard-read"]
)
```

#### üß† Model Parameters

You can adjust model behavior through temperature and timeout settings:

```python
# For deterministic behavior (e.g., exact UI interactions)
client = AsyncAzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint=endpoint,
    api_key=api_key,
    api_version=api_version,
    timeout=60.0,  # Increased timeout for larger screenshots
    max_retries=5,  # More retries for reliability
    default_headers={"x-ms-client-application-name": "computer-use-agent"}
)
```
